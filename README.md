### Build labs faster

Building a lab environment can be time-consuming.  Our platform provides,


- Quick on-demand containers and provisioning.
- Comprehensive list of various development containers.
- Stronger Authentication mechanism.
- Storage mechanism via docker volumes.
- Suitable for large scale deployments (Currently single node).

### Wargames
- Host container-based wargames easily on this platform.

### Unified Networking
- Gone those days where you need to setup the whole network configuration yourself to make nodes work together, our platform lets you focus on your work, taking care of the networking.
- Best for learning networking/Cloud tools that normally require manual configuration and are time consuming.      
## Setup:
- Setup host bridging with separate host virtual interface, and install docker plugin as explained here: [Initial Setup](https://github.com/VaradBelwalkar/Compute-Services/blob/master/configure/setup.md)
